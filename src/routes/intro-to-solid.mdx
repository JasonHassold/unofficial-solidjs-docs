SolidJS is a fast and flexible framework for building reactive user interfaces.

The reactivity system is built up from a powerful set of tools known as primitives.

From these simple reactive building blocks you can create large-scale UIs where state changes trigger efficient & precise updates.

```tsx
import { render } from 'solid-js/web'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0) // Signal
  const increment = () => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Count: {count()}</span> {/* Only `count()` is updated when the button is clicked. */}
      <button type="button" onClick={increment}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

render(() => <Counter />, document.getElementById('app')!)
```

# Rendering (JSX)

JSX is what SolidJS uses to render elements. It is an extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript file which keeps your rendering logic and content in the same place. This provides a concise and readable way to create and represent components.

It offers a distinct advantages like being able to copy/paste solutions from resources like Stack Overflow or use templates from design tools. Solid sets itself apart by using JSX to immediately return [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) elements. This lets you use expressions within your HTML by allowing variables and functions to be references with the use of curly braces `{ }`

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  const animal = { breed: 'cat', name: 'Midnight' }

  return (
    <p>
      I have a {animal.breed} named {animal.name}!
    </p>
  )
}
```

# Reactivity System

Reactivity is taking action when data changes. Fine-grained reactivity is taking only the specific actions needed for specific changes in data.

## Signals

Signals are the most primary reactive primitive. They allow you to store a piece of data and trigger updates when it changes.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)
//     ^ getter  ^ setter

// read a value
console.log(count()) // 0

// set a value
setCount(5)
console.log(count()) // 5
```

This just looks like a regular variable with extra steps. The real value comes from combining signals with subscribers.

## Subscribers

\*aka effects, computations, watchers, reactions

Subscribers are functions that subscribe to signals and do something when they update.

```tsx
import { createSignal, createEffect } from 'solid-js'

console.log('1. Create Signal')
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)

console.log('2. Create Reaction')
// subscribes to signals used inside and re-runs when they update
createEffect(() => console.log('The count is', count()))

console.log('3. Set count to 5')
setCount(5)

console.log('4. Set count to 10')
setCount(10)

/*
1. Create Signal
2. Create Reaction
The count is 0
3. Set count to 5
The count is 5
4. Set count to 10
The count is 10
*/
```

This looks a bit like magic at first, but it is the reason that signals need getters. Whenever the signal's getter is executed the wrapping function detects it and automatically subscribes to it.

Subscriptions happen automatically when they are used inside a tracking scope.

## Tracking scope

Think of tracking scopes as zones of reactivity. When signals are used inside of a tracking scope, it automatically subscribes to that signal and will rerun when any of the subscribed signals change.

Solid creates these scopes for you in key places:

1. **Subscriber Primitives**: The function passed to createEffect is a tracking scope.
2. **JSX**: The expressions {} inside your JSX are wrapped in tracking scopes. This is how your view stays up-to-date.

The key takeaway is that reactivity is contextual. If you read a signal's value _outside_ of a tracking scope, it will simply return the current value without creating a subscription. The code will not re-run when the signal changes.
